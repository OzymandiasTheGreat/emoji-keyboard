-------------------

Emoji support on Linux is shaky at best. Modern distributions finally support
displaying color emoji, but using emoji is inconsistent and inconvenient.

Enter `emoji-keyboard`! Press a hotkey (default `Ctrl+Super+Space`) or choose `Palette`
from app indicator and an emoji palette opens. Then just click on emoji you want to use
and watch them appear in the active application!

> **Tip:** hold shift when using the terminal and you can type emoji into the terminal

> **Tip:** you can choose to copy emoji into the clipboard instead in the `Preferences`

Easy.

Not sure which emoji to use? Press `Ctrl+Super+F` or choose `Search` from app indicator
and you can search emoji by name, short code or emoticon.

> **Tip:** don't want to use mouse after searching? Press up/down arrows and `Enter` to type

Got emoji you use frequently? Memorize short code (you can see it when hovering emoji
in the palette) and then just type it and watch it be replaced by the emoji.

> **Tip:** you can disable this feature in `Preferences`. It doesn't play well with Firefox

And of course there's eye-candy. Choose emoji set you prefer or app and panel themes to match your system.
